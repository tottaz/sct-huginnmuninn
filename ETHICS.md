# Ethics – sct-huginnmuninn

This project is maintained by [Social Climate Tech](https://socialclimate.tech) as part of the SocialLab program.  
We believe technology should empower people, not exploit them. Huginn & Muninn was built to encourage informed civic engagement while respecting privacy, accuracy, and fairness.

## 1. Data Sourcing
- **Public Information Only** – We only scrape news content that is freely and publicly available.
- **No Paywall Circumvention** – We do not bypass subscriptions, paywalls, or other access controls.
- **Respect for Robots.txt** – We respect each website’s crawling and indexing policies.

---

## 2. Accuracy and Bias
- **AI Limitations** – Large Language Models (LLMs) can reflect biases in their training data.  
  We encourage readers to view summaries as *interpretations* rather than absolute truths.
- **Multiple Perspectives** – Each article is analyzed through at least two lenses (public and political) to highlight how narratives can shift based on perspective.
- **Transparency of Sources** – Whenever possible, the original source link is included alongside the summary.

---

## 3. Privacy and Security
- **No Personal Data Collection** – We do not collect or process personally identifiable information (PII) from users.
- **Email Delivery** – If you enable email summaries, messages are sent securely via authenticated SMTP.

---

## 4. Responsible Automation
- **Rate Limiting** – The scraper is designed to minimize server load by pacing requests.
- **Local Models Option** – Users can run Ollama or other local LLMs to avoid sending data to third-party APIs.

---

## 5. Community Standards
We ask all contributors and users to:
- Avoid injecting partisan disinformation.
- Keep summaries civil and respectful.
- Flag problematic outputs in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/sct-huginnmuninn/issues).

*"Huginn fears that he will not return, but more I fear for Muninn."* – **Odin**, *Poetic Edda*  
We take both **thought** and **memory** seriously: the accuracy of facts and the context of history.
